# MACHINE LEARNING APPLICATIONS IN FORECASTING BANKRUPTCY RISKS OF REAL ESTATE BUSINESSES LISTED ON THE VIETNAM STOCK EXCHANGE
## ABSTRACT

The thesis is implemented to identify and forecast the bankruptcy risks of 57 real estate enterprises listed on the Vietnam stock market during 2011 to 2024. The secondary data is collected from audited financial statements at Fiinpro-X platform. The dependent variable – bankruptcy is estimated and predicted by 10 independent variables including: Working capital over total assets (WCAPAT), Total Liquidity Ratios (ALR), Total liabilities to total assets ratio (DTA), Short-term Debt to Long-term Debt ratio (SDR), Return on sales (ROS), Retained Earnings over Total assets (REAT), inventory turnover (IT), Receivables turnover ratio (RT), Asset turnover ratio (TAT), Price to Book (PB).

Utilizing machine learning algorithms such as: Decision Tree classification, Naïve Bayes, Artificial Neural Network Gradient Boosting and Logistic Regression. The study represents Logistic Regression model can work the most effectively in the prediction of real estate corporates bankruptcy risk. Working capital over total assets (WCAPTA), Retained Earnings over Total assets (REAT), Total liabilities to total assets ratio (DTA) and Asset turnover ratio (TAT) are four strong variables which effect on the bankruptcy risk of real estate enterprises.

According on the research results, the study refers to some appropriate managerial implications to assist these companies in operating effectively and contributing to the stabilization of the real estate market in Vietnam.
