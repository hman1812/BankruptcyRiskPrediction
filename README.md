# MACHINE LEARNING APPLICATIONS IN FORECASTING BANKRUPTCY RISKS OF REAL ESTATE BUSINESSES LISTED ON THE VIETNAM STOCK EXCHANGE
## ABSTRACT

The thesis is implemented to identify and forecast the bankruptcy risks of 57 real estate enterprises listed on the Vietnam stock market during 2011 to 2024. The secondary data is collected from audited financial statements at Fiinpro-X platform. The dependent variable – bankruptcy is estimated and predicted by 10 independent variables including: Working capital over total assets (WCAPAT), Total Liquidity Ratios (ALR), Total liabilities to total assets ratio (DTA), Short-term Debt to Long-term Debt ratio (SDR), Return on sales (ROS), Retained Earnings over Total assets (REAT), inventory turnover (IT), Receivables turnover ratio (RT), Asset turnover ratio (TAT), Price to Book (PB).

Utilizing machine learning algorithms such as: Decision Tree classification, Naïve Bayes, Artificial Neural Network Gradient Boosting and Logistic Regression. The study represents Logistic Regression model can work the most effectively in the prediction of real estate corporates bankruptcy risk. Working capital over total assets (WCAPTA), Retained Earnings over Total assets (REAT), Total liabilities to total assets ratio (DTA) and Asset turnover ratio (TAT) are four strong variables which effect on the bankruptcy risk of real estate enterprises.

According on the research results, the study refers to some appropriate managerial implications to assist these companies in operating effectively and contributing to the stabilization of the real estate market in Vietnam.

## Research Objectives
### General objectives
The general objective of this research is to identify and forecast the bankruptcy risks of real estate enterprises listed on the Vietnam stock market. According to the result, the study refers to some appropriate managerial implications to assist these companies in operating effectively and contributing to the stabilization of the real estate market in Vietnam.
### Specific objectives
To achieve general goals, the thesis has to implement three objectives including:
- Identifying some variables affecting to bankruptcy risk of real estate enterprises.
- Assessing and comparing all used-model in the study to suggest a model with the highest exact.
- Proposing some managerial implications to assist these companies in operating effectively and contributing to the stabilization of the real estate market in Vietnam.
## Conclusion
The thesis was conducted to forecast the bankruptcy risk of real estate companies listed on the Vietnam stock exchange during 2011-2024. To achieve that, the study begins with build the foundational basis for the research topic throughout chapter 1. In Chapter 2, the author summarizes and constructs the theoretical framework. It also identifies the research gap through a review of related empirical studies. The chapter 3 develops the model and determines the research methods. Through chapter 4, the study discusses the findings.
To achieve the general objective, the thesis proposes three specific objectives:
- The first objective: Identifying some variables affecting to bankruptcy risk of real estate enterprises.
Working capital over total assets (WCAPTA), Retained Earnings over Total assets (REAT), Total liabilities to total assets ratio (DTA) and Asset turnover ratio (TAT) are considered as four strong variables. First, Working capital over total assets (WCAPTA) and Retained Earnings over Total assets (REAT) inversely impact on the bankruptcy risk of real estate enterprises with regression coefficient at -13.26, -8.3402 respectively. Next, it is identified that Total liabilities to total assets ratio (DTA) has positive effect on Y at 5.5517. Asset turnover ratio (TAT) is at top 4 of the highest variables which negatively impacts on Y with regression coefficient at -1.4988.
In the other hand, the rest of variables consists of Inventory turnover (IT), Return on sales (ROS), Receivables turnover ratio (RT) and Total Liquidity Ratios (ALR). From the findings, they slightly inversely affect Y with regression coefficient at -0.04189, -0.001354, -0.004893, -0.000213 respectively while Price to Book (PB) and Short-term Debt to Long-term Debt ratio (SDR) is marginal impact with regression coefficient at -0.78298 and 0.0000385 respectively.
- The second objective: Assessing and comparing all used-model in the study to suggest a model with the highest exact.
In summary, after observing 798 non-financial enterprises for 14 years from 2011 to 2024 in the study of building a bankruptcy risk prediction model particularly Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naïve Bayes and Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression. All four models provide high accuracy and reliability. This is shown through the Accuracy index, specifically the logistic regression model with 93.75% accuracy, the random forest model with 91.88% accuracy, and the decision tree model with 89.38%. However, Naïve Bayes only achieved 68.13%. Especially in the confusion matrix, the Logistic Regression model gives the best results with the correct prediction of non-bankruptcy cases of 95 and the correct prediction of bankruptcy cases of 55 enterprises out of 160 enterprises. All the measurement indicators are the highest, namely Accuracy (93.75%), Precision (93.22%), Recall (90.16%), Specificity (95.96%), F1 –Score (91.67%) and AUC (98.33%). On the other hand, the Naïve Bayes model gives the lowest predictive ability in specific indicators Accuracy (68.13%), Precision (65.53%), Recall (34.43%), Specificity (88.89%), F1 –Score 45.16%) and AUC (62.03%) and is not reliable compared to other models. The Logistic Regression model can be effectively applied in practice to predict the risk of bankruptcy of real estate businesses. 
- The final objective: Proposing some managerial implications to assist these companies in operating effectively and contributing to the stabilization of the real estate market in Vietnam.
Regarding on the mentioned findings of the research in chapter 4, the thesis proposes related managerial implications to assist these companies in operating effectively and contributing to the stabilization of the real estate market in Vietnam in chapter 5.
## Managerial implications 
Based on the findings from the research, the author proposes some managerial implications to assist these companies in operating effectively and contribute to the stabilization of the real estate market in Vietnam following:

Firstly, the real estate enterprises should strengthen financial health and liquidity management. The research results show that indicators such as Working capital over total assets (WCAPAT) and Total Liquidity Ratio (ALR) have a significant impact on bankruptcy risk. Therefore, enterprises need to focus on maintaining a reasonable level of working capital to avoid liquidity crises. At the same time, it is necessary to optimize short-term debt management, especially indicators such as Short-term Debt to Long-term Debt ratio (SDR) and Total liabilities to total assets ratio (DTA). Building a cash reserve fund is also necessary to respond promptly to market fluctuations.

Secondly, the companies should consider to improve debt structure and reduce financial leverage. A high Total liabilities to total assets ratio (DTA) is one of the factors that significantly increases the risk of bankruptcy. Therefore, enterprises should restructure debt in the direction of reducing short-term debt and switching to more stable long-term loans through the findings of Short-term Debt to Long-term Debt ratio (SDR). Renegotiating loan terms can also help reduce short-term debt repayment pressure. At the same time, businesses need to strictly control the Total liabilities to total assets ratio (DTA) to ensure solvency and minimize financial risks.
- Thirdly, improving business efficiency and operational management is also important for real estate businesses. Indicators such as Return on Sales (ROS) and Asset turnover ratio (TAT) show that business efficiency is closely related to business viability. Businesses should strengthen cost control and price products appropriately to optimize profit margins. In addition, more efficient use of assets – such as accelerating inventory turnover (IT) and improving Receivables turnover ratio (RT). It will also contribute to improving operational efficiency. Diversifying revenue sources such as combining sales and leasing will help businesses reduce their dependence on traditional sales markets.

Next, strategic reinvestment and increased Retained Earnings need to concentrate on. A negative Retained Earnings over Total assets (REAT) indicates that companies that tend to reinvest less of their profits face higher financial risks. Therefore, companies should prioritize retaining profits and reinvesting in profitable projects instead of paying excessive dividends. Retained earnings play an important role to help companies withstand future financial shocks.
The enterprises should notice on Market Positioning and Valuation Management. A valuation that exceeds the intrinsic value (negative Price to Book) is a warning sign of market risk and potential bankruptcy. Companies should avoid following hot growth models or asset bubbles. Instead, valuation should be based on fundamental value, while financial transparency is needed to build trust with investors. Sustainable growth and transparent risk management are the foundation for long-term stability.

The application of machine learning forecasting models to proactively monitor bankruptcy risk. The logistic regression model in the study showed a forecasting accuracy of up to 93.75%, showing high potential for application in early warning of bankruptcy risks. Enterprises should apply an early warning system, which can integrate artificial intelligence (AI), to monitor important financial indicators such as liquidity, leverage and profitability. Periodic checks on financial pressure will help enterprises respond promptly to signs of instability.

Finally, the government propose market stabilization policies. Specifically, from a policy perspective, management agencies need to strengthen supervision of corporate borrowing activities, especially those with high financial leverage. It is possible to consider applying a debt/asset ratio ceiling to control systemic risks. At the same time, enterprises should be encouraged to prioritize long-term loans instead of short-term loans for speculation. On the part of industry associations, it is necessary to promote the dissemination of risk management standards and transparent information disclosure requirements to contribute to reducing fluctuations in the real estate market.
